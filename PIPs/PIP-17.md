### Abstract

This proposal describes an upgrade to MATIC (0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0) in the form of the Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL). POL is the upgraded native token of Polygon 2.0, along with its accompanying contracts and initial configurations to handle emission management and token migration. POL allows for a one-to-one migration with MATIC with an initial supply of 10 billion POL and yearly emission of 2% that will be equally distributed to stakers and a community treasury contract.


### Motivation

The token of the Polygon PoS chain, MATIC, powered this single chain that allowed Ethereum to scale during times of high network congestion. Polygon 2.0 is the next iteration in the Ethereum scaling journey, with zero-knowledge proofs (“zk”) facilitating the expansion of Ethereum block-space across a multitude of L2 chains whilst also inheriting its security.  

POL represents a next-generation token able to accommodate an ecosystem of zk-based Layer 2 chains by enabling the following utility:

* Staking,
* Community ownership, and
* Governance.

### Specification

#### POL Token Contract

A token contract, POL, is proposed, broadly based on the MIT-licensed OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementations which provide support for the default ERC20 standard, along with some non-standard functions for allowance modifications. The implementation also provides support for EIP-2612: Signature-Based Permit Approvals.

Upon genesis, an initial supply of 10 billion will be minted to a migration contract (see below for details). Further mints may be called by an emission manager contract (see below for details). Emission Managers can be managed by Governance. An additional check-in mint function requires the mint rate to be less than 10 POL per second.

The POL token contract is not upgradeable, however Permit2 default approvals can be enabled or disabled by Governance and is enabled by default.

#### Migration Contract

The migration contract will accept two addresses, one for the MATIC token and one for the POL token respectively.

The contract shall receive the entire initial 10 billion POL supply in order to allow 1-to-1 swaps for the entire 10 billion MATIC supply.

Governance can lock and unlock the ability to unmigrate POL tokens back into an equivalent amount of MATIC.

This contract is upgradeable via Governance with POL tokens also being burnable via Governance. The initial implementation is described below.

#### Emission Manager Contract

The emission manager contract has the exclusive ability to mint new POL tokens and is implemented to distribute the tokens as follows:

#### Validator Rewards 

Emissions are minted to the PoS staking contract (0x5e3ef299fddf15eaa0432e6e66473ace8c13d908) for staking rewards. After minting the appropriate amount of POL, the migration contract will be used to ensure that staking rewards continue to be paid out in MATIC, maximizing backward compatibility.

Year 1-3:

For years 1-3, the POL emissions schedule will follow the schedule defined in [PIP-26](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-26.md).

After Year 3:

-   1% annual compounding. 

#### Community Treasury

-   1% annual compounding emission is minted to a community treasury. Upon the deployment of contracts introduced in this proposal, a multi-signature wallet (0x2ff25495d77f380d5F65B95F103181aE8b1cf898) will be used to safeguard the funds until Community Board supervision is enacted.
    
A publicly callable function that is callable by any address can trigger the immediate minting of all vested emission.

This contract is upgradeable via Governance. The initial implementation is described below.

### Backward Compatibility

This proposal does not change any active systems on either the Polygon PoS or Polygon zkEVM networks. All existing contracts will function as previously designed.

### Security Considerations

In the event of an exploit, to prevent arbitrary amounts of POL being minted, there is a variable hard cap on the maximum amount of tokens allowed to be minted per second. It is initialized at a maximum allowed number of 10 POL to be minted per second.

Due to the size, complexity, and importance of the proposed POL contracts, there will be several internal and external code audits to ensure the security of the implementation detailed above.
